        <font color = "0c343d">Here at Harry and Harriet's, we offer the best quality parachutes available. Our parachutes are made of special Ripstop Nylon material that is made to be
        elastic while giving the parachute a long life. Additionally, our parachutes are made to be rounded so that they open more efficiently and smoothly while also
        consuming less altitude as you descend. For inexperienced users, we recommend that you follow this guide: <a href = "https://wisconsinskydivingcenter.com/blog/how-parachutes-work/#:~:text=Drawing%20on%20the%20right%20steering,of%20descent%20by%20flattening%20out."

        <font color = "0c343d">Here at Harry and Harriet's, we offer the best quality hang gliders available. We have experts you can meet with in store to discuss which hang glider is right
        for you. For online shoppers, here are some factors that will affect which hang glider you will want to buy:
        <ul>
            <li><u><b><i>Experience:</i></b></u></li> Users with less experience tend to prefer gliders with more bar pressure and truncated tips because they are easier to control.
            <li><u><b><i>Weight:</i></b></u></li> Your weight and strength heavily affect both your ability to control the hang glider as well as the speed at which you travel.
            <li><u><b><i>Flying Location:</i></b></u></li> Depending on your location and goals, you may wish to have a stable glider or a glider that can maneuver exceptionally well.
        </ul>
